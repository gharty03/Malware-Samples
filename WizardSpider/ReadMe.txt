WizardSpider is the name of a cybercrime syndicate with ties to the Russian government.
They are a highly advanced threat actor, utilizing advanced tools such as CobaltStrike, and the Trickbot banking trojan. 
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, WizardSpider publicly allied themselves with the Kremlin,
this resulted in a member of the crime syndicate leaking a massive amount of data about them.
This repo contains many of the leaked files, aside from the onboarding documents, which can be found on VX-Underground.
Many long suspected details about the group were confirmed thanks to this leak, the group is a truly massive in size
at 80+ members. They are structured more like a professional software development shop than a cybercrime syndicate, 
it is easy to see why the sit at the top of the totem in the Ransomware as a service black market. 

Also included in the chat log leaks, is a moment where a member of WizardSpider asks how to close out of VIM,
showing that even advanced Russian hackers need help closing VIM sometimes too. 

The Locker Code is missing the CPP files, this is because Windows defender decided to auto nuke them.
Thankfully I still had a backup of the Locker files which can be found on my Conti-Ransomware Repository.
